# Copy this API and build an app that has the following:
  1. An index listing each character.                   
  2. A controlled form to add a new character to the index (non persisting).
  3. A controlled form to dynamically filter characters by name.

#### When finished, push up to Github as a new repository, add me as a collaborator, and enter your name and repo url here #
  ----
## If you finish early tackle one or both of the Bonus suggestions
## Bonus suggestions:
  1. A dropdown that allows you to filter characters by show
  2. Ability to list a character as a favorite

  ----
## Rules for this assignment:
  1. You are not allowed to collaborate with your classmates. I want to see how much you are able to complete on your own
  2. However, you are allowed to ask your instructors for help. Although they will not give you the answer, I've instructed Annie and Chase to be a bit more liberal with how much help they give you for this assignment
  3. Everyone should submit their work by 12pm and this will count as morning attendance. Even if you haven't completed the assignment you should still submit what you have

  ***The Study Hall link on the calendar is there to give you a place to easily ask questions to your instructors. Joining is not mandatory since your assignment submission will be your attendance. However, if you want to join and hang out to hear discussions that your classmates are having with your instructors you are welcome to do so. If you'd like to ask us questions 1 on 1 then we'll just jump to a breakout room and then go back to the main room afterward***

















# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
